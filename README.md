This game is Egyptian Ratscrew.

The game is played with a 52 card deck, and there are two players (you and a bot opponent).

If there is a face card (Jack, Queen, King, Ace), you will have to draw a certain amount of cards.

Jack: 1, Queen: 2, King: 3, Ace: 4

If you pull another face card while drawing, this is cancelled out.

If no face cards are pulled, the person who drew gets the entire deck.

Players take turns playing a card, and hit the slap button when there are card combinations.

The card combinations:
Marriage (king or queen)
Doubles (two of the same)
Top Bottom (top card and bottom card)
Sandwich (double with another card between the two)

If the slap is legitimate, then the player will get the entire middle deck.

The player who gets every card in the deck is the winner.
